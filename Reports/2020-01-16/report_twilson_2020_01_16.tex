\title{\LARGE \bf
Report Jan 2020 -- Attempts at parameterising an empirical AUF
}


\author{Tom J. Wilson% <-this % stops a space
}	

% currently to create AUFs we simulate PSFs with monte carlo random runs, based on stellar/galactic number densities -- previously this was fine because we could use simulated Milky Way data, but LSST goes too faint
% attempts at creating in situ AUFs, which can therefore contain all non-statistical-noise related perturbations to source positions, using the data themselves
% to do so we need both cross-matches (using Gaia to have an essentially one-sided problem) to create AUFs for those sources we detect; and could then consider first moments of randomly placed PSF circles where no star exists -- or residuals, if detected source subtracted images were available -- in data frames to get the AUF of stars below the detection limit of the survey

% to get the "extra" terms in the AUF for cross-matches, we can simply deconvolve the statistical gaussian component
% however, previous code using Hankel transforms for the radially symmetric Fourier-Bessel transforms is not sufficiently high resolution to capture the necessary precision for division -- for convolution instead of deconvolution this is ok because the numerical inprecision goes away, but with a ratio the error is magnified
% thus an attempt was made to fit a MoG model to the full cross-match AUF, on the grounds that convolution, and deconvolution, of gaussians is an analytic expression. However, limitations on sigma being >= sigma_statistical (to avoid imaginary numbers in the deconvolution) result in an unphysical perturbation AUF, which may technically work but does not inform about the system at all.

% also explored the attempts to consolidate the number of parameters needed to describe the AUF, by testing whether an effective stellar density could be used, instead of an overall normalising density -- this may work for the very brightest sources where almost all fainter objects in questions are described by a power law (which allows it to work), but very rapidly the turnover in stellar counts renders the tradeoff between central star magnitude and overall local density asymmetric
