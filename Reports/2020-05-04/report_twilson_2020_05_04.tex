% Change log
%
% v3.0 May 2015
%    Renamed to match the new package name
%    Version number matches mnras.cls
%    A few minor tweaks to wording
% v1.0 September 2013
%    Beta testing only - never publicly released
%    First version: a simple (ish) template for creating an MNRAS paper

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[fleqn,usenatbib]{mnras}

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX
% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{ae,aecompl}

\section{Introduction}


\section{The Photometric Limit of the Perturbation AUF}
\label{sec:photolimits}
Stuff about the new $\Delta m$ constraint based on Poissonian 1\% likelihood of drawing of $N$ objects $\Delta m$ magnitudes below the bright central object

\section{Flux Contamination Computations at all Signal-to-Noise Ratios}
Stuff about using PSF fitting algorithms to derive astrometric perturbations and photometric contaminations for bright objects. Assume that the flux-weighted centroid applies at high SNRs (where noise considersations reduce the PSF to a single ``important'' point), and the Gaussian-convolution method applies at faint magnitudes where noise is constant; need to know what to do for $\Delta f$ at high SNRs, however. Also, point out that if the fitting algorithm does not use uncertainty information then log-likelihood method \textit{should} apply at all SNRs.

\section{Conclusion}
