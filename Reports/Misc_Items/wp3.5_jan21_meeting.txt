- Solar reflex motion
Discussion of effect, how to handle if reference frame has PMs and if actual data have PMs
HSC and pipeline, at what point does solar reflex motion affect? First astrometric solution or final merged catalogue okay?
VISTA+LSST at 10-year baseline, so forced photometry needs to be at different position than assumed one -- up to 0.1 arcsecond offset
What tests can be done? VISTA+single-epoch LSST affected
What fraction of VISTA sources have no gaia counterpart? A lot, apparently, 90% of plane K-band sources; maybe 10% of out of plane

VVV might be ok, VHS not? Many epochs -> solve for proper motions; talk to Leigh for proper motions -- catalogues include eDR3 time-wound Gaia source reference frame

Next steps for us a HSC test -- agree a region to test in common with WP3.5; they run SSDS and XMM -- WP3.5 to name sky coordinates and point to the data

prototype HSC almost ready -- talk to Raphael to get access
reference frame change? DR2 vs eDR3? HSC only down to -30deg -- uses Gaia (DR1?)-PS1 cross-match


Actions:
Raphael to check reference frame of HSC
Raphael to send prototype HSC: ~10s of square degrees (maybe via DAC)
Tom to check quoted astrometric uncertainties of catalogue, to compare with other systematic offsets like reflex motion
Tom to check models for solar reflex motion, to establish if they solve the issue
