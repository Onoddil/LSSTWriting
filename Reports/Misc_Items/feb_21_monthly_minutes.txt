Monthly Minutes, February 2021

Tim Naylor & Tom Wilson


Funding Extension:
Waiting for Exeter to send Tom a contract with the new dates

D3.11.3:
Code fine, just finishing up tests. Either on schedule or a month ahead, depending on the confusion of the month lead time on report submission.
Then it's original algorithm's perturbation AUF code, with extension to D3.11.1 new algorithms afterwards.

Proper Motions Report:
Tim gave comments on writeup, needs working once finished
Issues with whatever potential errors are present need fixing to polish the report
Normalisation might need looking in plots
Distances/parallaxes might be an issue -- not Bailer-Jones distance errors, but parallax bias
	Can potentially use Bailer-Jones distances as inverse parallaxes (actually Bailer-Jones distances ARE similar to Lutz-Kelker bias distances, if those biases are viewed as a prior) to compare to TRILEGAL, to check if distributions compare better in parallax, to check if TRILEGAL is drawing distributions of sources right
